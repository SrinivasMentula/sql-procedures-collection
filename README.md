# SQL Server Mini Projects

Welcome to my collection of SQL Server mini projects! This repository showcases a variety of stored procedures and scripts designed to solve real-world data problems using T-SQL. Each procedure is crafted with performance, readability, and reusability in mind. Whether it's generating sales reports, segmenting customers, or handling data transformations, these projects reflect practical use cases often encountered in data engineering and analytics workflows.

This collection also demonstrates how SQL logic can be integrated with tools like **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** for end-to-end data pipeline automation.

Feel free to explore, learn, or use these scripts as a reference for your own work!
