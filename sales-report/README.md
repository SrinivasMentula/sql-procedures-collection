# Sales Report Procedure

This mini-project contains a stored procedure (`usp_SalesReport`) designed to generate detailed sales reports based on transactional data. It uses temporary tables and optimized joins to produce region-wise and date-wise sales summaries.

The procedure is intended to be called after data ingestion, and is suitable for integration with tools like Azure Data Factory (ADF) for automated reporting workflows.
